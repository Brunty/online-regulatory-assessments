# README

This repository holds the assessments related to various services I run.

For example, these are used for the UK's Online Safety Act. As much as that act is ridiculous and doesn't cater properly for small, single-user, self-hosted, community and volunteer-run services. Some of which have had to shut down. See [https://onlinesafetyact.co.uk/in_memoriam/](https://onlinesafetyact.co.uk/in_memoriam/) for more information.

# Thanks

Thanks to [Neil Brown](https://mastodon.neilzone.co.uk/@neil) for his work on breaking down OSA and providing templates for this sort of thing.

Thanks to [Derick Rethans](https://phpc.social/@derickr) for publishing assessments and information, while I haven't used them directly, I have read through them for my own understanding of things.
