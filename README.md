This repository holds the assessments related to various services I run.

For example, these are used for the UK's Online Safety Act. As much as that act is ridiculous and doesn't cater properly for small, single-user, self-hosted, community and volunteer-run services. Some of which have had to shut down. See [https://onlinesafetyact.co.uk/in_memoriam/](https://onlinesafetyact.co.uk/in_memoriam/) for more information.
