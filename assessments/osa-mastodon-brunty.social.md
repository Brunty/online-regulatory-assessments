## Ofcom's suggested steps
 - Step 1: Understand the kinds of illegal content that need to be assessed
 - Step 2: Assess the risk of harm
 - Step 3: Decide measures, implement, and record
 - Step 4: Report, review, and update

## Ofcom's risk factors

My fediverse instance is a social media platform.

I am the only person who can post to it.

I choose what I boost. If I boost something, it will be available to others who view my instance (e.g. via the web interface).

If someone replies to my posts, or if I reply to someone else's post (on another instance), those replies will be available to others who view my instance.

There is no access control, meaning that it is accessible to anyone in the world, without registration.

According to Ofcom's risk factors guidance, it is possible that my instance meets some or all of the following.

 - 1a (Social media)
 - 2 (child access): there is no access control, so a child could view my instance. Nothing on my instance is particularly attractive to children
 - 3a (user profiles): I have a profile. Visitors may be able to access the profiles of users of other instances through my instance
 - 4a (user connections): people on other instances can follow me
 - 5b (direct messaging): between someone on another instance and me, which I think, per s227(3), should be out of scope
 - 5e (posting images or videos): I can post images/videos, and that should be out of scope. Replies visible through my instance might contain images or videos; profiles may contain images
 - 5g (boosting of content): I can boost content, so that should be out of scope
 - 7b (hyperlinks): I can post hyperlinks. Replies and profiles may contain hyperlinks

## Priority illegal content

| Type of content | Risk factors (from Ofcomâ€™s risk profiles)<sup>[1](#fn-1)<a name="fnref-1"></a></sup>   | Conclusion<sup>[2](#fn-2)<a name="fnref-2"></a></sup> | Rationale | Measures<sup>[3](#fn-3)<a name="fnref-3"></a></sup> | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Terrorism | 1a, 4a, 5,b, 5e, 7b | Negligible | The likelihood of a visitor encountering this content, or the service being used to facilitate or commit this offence, is incredibly low. I do not post this kind of content (and, in any case, the content that I post should be out of scope since I am the provider, and thus, arguably at least, not a user). It would only arise if I were to boost such content or reply to such content (which I would not do) or if someone were to reply to my toots with such content. If that were to happen, I would block the user account, thereby suppressing the content, promptly upon becoming aware of it. I have run this service for many years, and I am not aware of instances of this type of content during that time. | None | 
| Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CSEA): Grooming | 1a, 2, 3a, 4a, 5b | Negligible | The likelihood of a visitor encountering this content, or the service being used to facilitate or commit this offence, is incredibly low. I do not post this kind of content (and, in any case, the content that I post should be out of scope since I am the provider, and thus, arguably at least, not a user). It would only arise if I were to boost such content or reply to such content (which I would not do) or if someone were to reply to my toots with such content. If that were to happen, I would block the user account, thereby suppressing the content, promptly upon becoming aware of it. I have run this service for many years, and I am not aware of instances of this type of content during that time. Although I do not have any form of access control in place, meaning that children can access my instance, nothing I post is likely to be of particular interest to children. | None |
| Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CSEA): Images | 1a, 2, 5b | Negligible | The likelihood of a visitor encountering this content, or the service being used to facilitate or commit this offence, is incredibly low. I do not post this kind of content (and, in any case, the content that I post should be out of scope since I am the provider, and thus, arguably at least, not a user). It would only arise if I were to boost such content or reply to such content (which I would not do) or if someone were to reply to my toots with such content. If that were to happen, I would block the user account, thereby suppressing the content, promptly upon becoming aware of it. I have run this service for many years, and I am not aware of instances of this type of content during that time. | None |
| Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CSEA): URLs | 7b  | Negligible risk | The likelihood of a visitor encountering this content, or the service being used to facilitate or commit this offence, is incredibly low. I do not post this kind of content (and, in any case, the content that I post should be out of scope since I am the provider, and thus, arguably at least, not a user). It would only arise if I were to boost such content or reply to such content (which I would not do) or if someone were to reply to my toots with such content. If that were to happen, I would block the user account, thereby suppressing the content, promptly upon becoming aware of it. I have run this service for many years, and I am not aware of instances of this type of content during that time. My toots delete automatically, currently within a day or so of posting unless they are particularly popular. As such, if a domain were to change hands, or a URL were to point to a different resource, after I had tooted it, unless it was a particularly popular toot, it is highly unlikely that anyone would encounter the content now present at the URL by virtue of my toot. | None |
| Encouraging or assisting suicide | 1a, 5e, 5g, 7b | Negligible | The likelihood of a visitor encountering this content, or the service being used to facilitate or commit this offence, is incredibly low. I do not post this kind of content (and, in any case, the content that I post should be out of scope since I am the provider, and thus, arguably at least, not a user). It would only arise if I were to boost such content or reply to such content (which I would not do) or if someone were to reply to my toots with such content. If that were to happen, I would block the user account, thereby suppressing the content, promptly upon becoming aware of it. I have run this service for many years, and I am not aware of instances of this type of content during that time. | None |

I have run this service for many years, and I am not aware of instances of this type of content during that time. | None |
| Harassment, stalking, threats and abuse | 1a, 3a, 4a, 5b, 5e, 5g | Negligible | The likelihood of a visitor encountering this content, or the service being used to facilitate or commit this offence, is incredibly low. I do not post this kind of content (and, in any case, the content that I post should be out of scope since I am the provider, and thus, arguably at least, not a user). It would only arise if I were to boost such content or reply to such content (which I would not do) or if someone were to reply to my toots with such content. If that were to happen, I would block the user account, thereby suppressing the content, promptly upon becoming aware of it. I have run this service for many years, and I am not aware of instances of this type of content during that time. | None |

## Safety duties about illegal content

The following sets out my approach to compliance with the various safety duties in [s10 OSA](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/section/10/enacted).

See also [Ofcom's recommended measures (table on page 8)](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/illegal-harms/illegal-content-codes-of-practice-for-user-to-user-services.pdf?v=387711).

### Proportionality

Some of the duties require me to take "proportionate measures".

In determining what is proportionate, the OSA says that "the size and capacity of the provider of the service" are particularly relevant.

To that end, I have a somewhat significant capacity for being caring and understanding.

### Duties and approach

| Duty | My approach |
| --- | --- |
| To prevent individuals from encountering priority illegal content by means of the service | I will continue to defederate with servers likely to contain problematic content. I will not toot or boost priority illegal content. I will not reply to other people's toots containing priority illegal content. If priority illegal content is posted to my instance by a third party (e.g. by way of a reply), I will block the user and, where appropriate, report the toot to the user's server administrator. |
| To effectively mitigate and manage the risk of the service being used for the commission or facilitation of a priority offence | I will not toot or boost priority illegal content. I will not reply to other people's toots containing priority illegal content. If priority illegal content is posted to my instance by a third party (e.g. by way of a reply), I will block the user and, where appropriate, report the toot to the user's server administrator. Where appropriate, I can defederate from the entire server. |
| To effectively mitigate and manage the risks of harm to individuals | No additional actions planned |
| To minimise the length of time for which any priority illegal content is present | If I become aware of priority illegal content, I will promptly block the user and, where appropriate, report the toot to the user's server administrator. Any third party can report toots available via my instance to me. I get an email notification, enabling me to view the report. |
| Where the provider is alerted by a person to the presence of any illegal content, or becomes aware of it in any other way, swiftly take down such content | As above. |
| To have in place regulatory compliance and risk management arrangements | I do not consider that these are proportionate to the risk. |
| design of functionalities, algorithms and other features | I will continue to review the features available in Mastodon to reduce the risk of individuals encountering priority illegal content, and the risk of the service being used for the commission or facilitation of a priority offence. |
| policies on terms of use | I am the only registered user of this instance and so, while the OSA might indicate that people who interact with my instance from their own instances are still "my" users, in reality they are not going to follow any terms of use that I might promulgate, especially if they are going to post priority illegal content. |
| policies on user access to the service or to particular content present on the service, including blocking users from accessing the service or particular content | I will promptly block users who post priority illegal content on their own instances in such a way that others can encounter it via my instance. I will, where appropriate, report the offending toot to the offending person's server administrator. |
| content moderation, including taking down content | As above |
| functionalities allowing users to control the content they encounter | This is a function of the user's own instance controls, or controls of any software that they use for accessing their instance. Nothing I can do can effect this. |
| user support measures | This is not relevant to my instance |
| staff policies and practices | This is not relevant to my instance |
| to include provisions in the terms of service specifying how individuals are to be protected from illegal content | There are no terms of service because, in reality, users are users of their own instances, not mine. |
| A duty to apply the provisions of the terms of service consistently | As above |
| A duty to include provisions in the terms of service giving information about any proactive technology used by a service for the purpose of compliance with a duty set out in s10(2) or 10(3) (including the kind of technology, when it is used, and how it works). | As above |
| A duty to ensure that the provisions of the terms of service are clear and accessible | As above |

In accordance with [s66](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/section/66/enacted), if I were to become aware of unreported CSEA, I will report it to the NCA.
